## Data Visualization 551 Project

## 1. Proposal
   
### Motivation and Purpose
Our project aims to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard that provides insights into breast cancer diagnosis based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The goal is to empower medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers with an intuitive tool to analyze key factors influencing breast cancer classification and patient outcomes.

### 2. Description of the Data
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 numerical features describing various characteristics of cell nuclei present in digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies. The key variables include:

•	Mean, Standard Error, and Worst Values for radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

•	Diagnosis: A categorical variable indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

For visualization, we will focus on a subset of features that are most indicative of breast cancer diagnosis, such as mean radius, mean texture, mean concavity, and worst perimeter, while providing summary statistics for the rest.

## 3. Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

1.	What features contribute most to distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors?
2.	How do different tumor characteristics correlate with malignancy?
3.	Can we identify trends in diagnosis based on cell nucleus properties?



## Usage Scenario

Dr. Emily is an oncologist at a cancer research institute. She wants to understand how tumor characteristics influence breast cancer diagnosis to improve early detection strategies. She logs into the app, selects key tumor features, and visualizes their distribution between benign and malignant cases. She notices that worst perimeter and mean concavity are strong indicators of malignancy. She exports this insight for further analysis in her research team.

## 4. Description of the App & Sketch

The dashboard will have a user-friendly interface that includes:

•	Homepage: Overview of dataset distribution with summary statistics.

•	Feature Exploration Panel: Interactive visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, violin plots) to compare tumor features across diagnosis categories.

•	Correlation Matrix: Heatmap displaying relationships between different tumor characteristics.

•	Custom Analysis Section: Users can select specific features to generate tailored visualizations.

•	Download & Reporting: Users can export graphs and reports for further analysis.

A hand-drawn or digitally created sketch of the app will be uploaded to the GitHub repository, displaying the interface layout and interactions.

## 5. Team Work Contract and Collaborative Documentation

## Work Distribution

•	Tasks will be divided based on expertise, availability, and interest.

•	Each member will contribute equally to data preprocessing, visualization development, documentation, and testing.

## Expected Work Hours & Meetings

•	We will meet twice a week for progress updates.

•	Members will provide async updates in Slack/Discord between meetings.

## Work Style

•	Code and reports will be committed to GitHub with meaningful commit 
messages.

•	Stand-ups in meetings to summarize contributions and blockers.

## Quality Expectations

•	All code will be reviewed via GitHub pull requests before merging.

•	Visualizations should be clear, interpretable, and well-labeled.

•	Documentation must be concise and comprehensive.

## Availability & Communication

•	Members will communicate unavailability in advance.

•	Any major decisions will be made via consensus.

## Code of Conduct

Our team is committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and harassment-free collaboration environment. We expect all members to:

•	Treat each other with respect and professionalism.

•	Welcome constructive feedback and diverse perspectives.

•	Address conflicts openly and resolve them collaboratively.

•	Refrain from discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate conduct.

Any violations should be reported to the team lead, and appropriate action will be taken.
